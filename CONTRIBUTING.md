## Installation from Source

Prior to contributing, you must be able to run the test suite.
To achieve this, you need to acquire the source code and install all dependencies:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/hendrikmaus/reynaldo.git`
2. Get [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
3. `cd reynaldo && composer install`

Composer will take care of installing all required dependencies.
Watch the command output to spot errors.

## Run the tests
You can either use `composer test` or `vendor/bin/phpunit`.
